# Space admission qualification — 2026-11-01 JST

Qualified source: `cf43975fdc73e13c2f8aa46d903e1be6220a08d9` on
`feat/spaces-and-app-data`, with a clean source tree. This is the authority and
browser admission increment of [RFC 0027](../rfcs/0027-spaces-and-app-data.md), not
completion of all four milestones or a Frame deployment. The [management guide](../SPACES.md)
records the current contracts, rollout procedure and unavailable lifecycle stages.

## Results

- Nine covered runtime tests pass for roles, multiple Admins, last-Admin protection,
  binding identity, retained collection identity, revocation/readmission, current
  installed-policy constraints and registry framing recovery.
- Real authority/child-client scenarios pass for independent Space values,
  unauthorized reads/writes, explicit Frame identity, active revocation/reconnect,
  Member management denial and concurrent last-Admin changes.
- Offline provisioning preserves a confirmed legacy value through journal replay,
  migration and restart. A completed manifest does not regrant a revoked member;
  a failed import leaves admission unavailable. Omitting the CLI flag does not
  reopen legacy access to a migrated state directory.
- A separately bound Monitoring collector can publish its collection's view;
  human Admins cannot publish it, and the collector receives no human membership.
  An independently attached Monitoring collection receives none of that view.
- The native owner test revokes a held frame before renderer credit returns for
  both private apps and ordinary apps used inside a Closed Space.

The repeatable Chromium probe signs in through the normal form using independent
cookie contexts. Two clients see Space A change from 0 to 1, while Space B stays 0.
Anonymous and authenticated non-Members receive denial. Removing the Member clears
that client's view; the remaining Admin continues editing Space A to 2. The probe
reports no runtime exceptions and preserves release-control v1.

The [machine-readable report](data/spaces-admission-2026-11-01.json) records source,
authority/Wasm artifact digests and the signed browser fixture ID. The fixture
contains real browser and app bytes, with disposable signing keys and test data;
it contains no native executable and was never activated on Frame.

## Commands and limits

`bash scripts/check.sh` passed, including strict Clippy, workspace tests, real
process/session/bundle checks and Linux evdev fixtures. The native held-frame
case also passed directly through `cargo test -p otrios-dashboard --features
server,canvas,host-sync --test native_owner
app_transport_receives_remote_edits_reconnects_and_revokes_a_held_frame --locked
--offline`.

The browser build used Rust 1.90.0, the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target and pinned
wasm-bindgen 0.2.129. After building the authority/example and web package from the
tested source, `python3 scripts/qualify-spaces-browser.py` passed against freshly
created disposable authorities and isolated Chromium contexts. The probe shuts
down those authorities and removes test credentials/signing keys afterward.

One intermediate full run failed the existing retained-document keyed-window
packing-count test. It passed in isolation and in subsequent full runs; no
retained-document code was changed for this increment.

This report establishes local authority/browser behavior and native-owner adapter
behavior. ARM execution, physical Frame presentation, signed live cutover and its
rollback remain unqualified here. No Linux shared-memory IPC claim is made.

## Collection-aware mount checkpoint

Clean source `9392387753f91f667b7e1a6ea2cb39e9513efbf5` passed the full
`scripts/check.sh` suite and the same rebuilt Chromium qualification with zero
runtime exceptions. The [v9 report](data/spaces-mount-binding-2026-11-01.json)
records the exact authority/Wasm digests and fixture release. Release-control v1
is unchanged; state protocol v9 carries the collection/action binding and first
aggregate view before candidate acceptance. Added runtime tests distinguish
same-collection pending-intent recovery from replacement-collection or read-only
admission, and prove read admission cannot allocate writer receipts or gain write
capability. This checkpoint also remains local qualification only.

## Shared-session discovery checkpoint

Clean source `9f94f26142c1280fa7e3b649704fa352072abebb` passed the full
`scripts/check.sh` suite, 14 direct Node session tests, and the rebuilt Chromium
probe with zero runtime exceptions. The [v10 report](data/spaces-discovery-2026-11-01.json)
records its exact artifacts. Added covered checks exercise metadata filtering,
the maximum-size snapshot, malformed management frames and lost-reply recovery
without management replay. A real shared-session scenario races initial capture
with attachment, observes subsequent changes, rejects Member management and
removes a revoked Member's closed-Space metadata. This qualifies the channel and
host adapters; shared Apps & Data controls and physical Frame remain pending.

## Current-policy activation checkpoint

Clean source `1401d2f5408d8538c5ceb12d2c435cc3a0cb3969` passed the full
`scripts/check.sh` suite and rebuilt Chromium qualification with zero runtime
exceptions. The [v11 report](data/spaces-activation-2026-11-01.json) identifies its
artifacts. Managed candidates now remain invisible until an authority Activated
reply. Covered tests hold protected candidate state/aggregate content offscreen,
discard denied/disconnected/cancelled candidates and preserve late reconnect
edits only within matching bindings. A real authority scenario revokes membership
between qualification and acceptance, receives denial rather than activation,
rejects the subsequent write and verifies unchanged data through another client.
These results still do not establish physical Frame acceptance.
